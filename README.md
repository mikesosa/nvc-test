# FRONTEND TECHNICAL TEST

At NVC Software we are developing new projects that integrate with various market applications such as IMDB (Internet Movie Database), for which it is necessary to implement a Proof of Concept (POC) that allows visualizinga novel way, the results of searches on movies in this database.

1. The module must include an “infinite scroll” control where the user can
scroll through all results. The software should load
automatically more results, as the user advances in the scroll.
2. The search field must not accept special characters such as "#" or "@".
3. If a search does not return results, the system must inform the user.
4. If a search is too complex or an error occurs, the system should
inform the user.
5. The graphical interface will be tested on PC computers, it does not need to be
responsive design or elastic design.
Technical requirements of the proof of concept
1. IMDB services must be invoked from a basic HTML5 page, using
for this: Ajax, JQuery and JSON.
2. To use the IMDB API you must use a FrontEnd framework,
preferably ReactJS and Redux.
3. The css styles should be grouped in a single file.
4. Optional point: Use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS.
5. Optional point: Better if you use a version of Reactjs and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
